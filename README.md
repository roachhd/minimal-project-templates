#Icenium "Minimal Project Templates"

This Visual Studio extension works with Visual Studio 2012. It installs 4 project templates - each of which do *not* contain the sample app boilerplate included in the original 4 project templates that ship with the Icenium Extension for Visual Studio.

To install, you can simply pull down the `Icenium.Minimal.Project.Templates/bin/Release/Icenium.Minimal.Project.Templates.vsix` file. Once you save it locally, double-click it and follow the installation instructions.
